<h2>See your listening habits from the previous year or any previous year...</h2>

<p>When you use Libre.fm to keep track of your listening habits, you get an end of year recap that's available from January 1st every year, which recaps all of the top artists and songs from the previous year.</p>

<p>For 2025 and beyond I've added monthly statistics too.</p>

<p>You can see my recap for yourself: <a href="https://libre.fm/user/mattl/recap/2025">mattl's recap for 2025</a></p>
