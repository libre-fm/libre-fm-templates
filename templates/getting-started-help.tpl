<h2>How to get started with scrobbling</h2>
<p>Libre.fm helps you keep track of your music listening habits. How? The specifics depend on how you listen to music, but fundamentally it works like this:</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>You configure your music player, a third-party app or a browser extension to point to your Libre.fm account</li>
<li>You listen to some music</li>
<li>Your computer reports the song title, artist and album to Libre.fm and it appears on your profile</li>
</ol>

<p>This is called <em>scrobbling</em>.</p>

<p class="lead">To get started you need to pick and then configure a piece of software we call a client. These are all independent pieces of software which can scrobble to Libre.fm on your behalf. There are lots of choices of client, some that we know work well for people starting out include:</p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mattl/hacienda/wiki/Web-Scrobbler">Web Scrobbler</a> &mdash; this is perfect if you listen to music from <a href="http://open.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a> or <a href="https://music.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple Music</a> in a web browser (we like Firefox, but most browsers are supported)</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mattl/hacienda/wiki/DeaDBeeF">DeadBeeF</a> &mdash; is a great desktop app for Windows, macOS and Unix-like systems</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mattl/hacienda/wiki/Pano-Scrobbler">Pano</a> is a great app for Android phones and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mattl/hacienda/wiki/Finale">Finale</a> works well for iPhones but requires a Last.fm account as well, but we hope they fix this soon!</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mattl/hacienda/wiki/ZOMG">ZOMG</a> is a command-line client from early-Libre.fm developer, <a href="https://libre.fm/user/clint">Clint</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>I am making a channel of videos on using Libre.fm with various scrobbler clients.</h3>

</ul>

<p><mark>What videos would you like to see next?</mark> Let me know in the YouTube comments or <a href="mailto:support@libre.fm">support@libre.fm</a></p>

<p>More clients can be found on <a href="https://github.com/mattl/hacienda/wiki" target="_blank">the wiki</a> which also has instructions on contributing to the wiki if you know of other clients (or email them to support!).</p>
<p>Finally, we have <a href="https://developer.libre.fm" target="_blank">information for developers who want to add Libre.fm support</a> to their existing clients or create new ones</p>
<p>If none of these solutions work for you, please contact <a href="mailto:support@libre.fm">support@libre.fm</a> and we can try and help you find something.</p>
